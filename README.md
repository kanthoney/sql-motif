# sql-motif

The `sql-motif` package is an sql query generator. It is designed so that it can also generate parts of queries so that, if the generator is unable to create a particular query
then you can still use it to generate the tedious parts such as field lists.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @kanthoney/sql-motif
```
